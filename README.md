This mod is a plugin of Simple Voice Chat which adds a simple radio item you can use to communicate with your friends while far away!

When holding right click on the radio, you will transmit your voice to other players in the same group.

Other functionality like proximity chat (should) remain the same.

## Current Features
- Craft a radio item that transmits voice over groups

## Planned Features
- Apply a radio filter over audio transmitted through radio
- Switching to frequencies instead of groups to give more control to the players
- A radio *block* that can listen to frequencies and output the audio from it

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/CodinGlitch/SimpleRadio/wiki) for more information on the features of the mod.
